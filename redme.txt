Lab NODE 1

Objective:

A flat file contains student records in JSON format. Write a program to parse and process these student records. This lab session involves File IO, Handling of JSON Strings, and XML Documents in Node.js.

Requirements: Part 1:

Assume, there is a JSON file (source.json) that contains student records along with scores of each student such as:

"students": 
	[
		{
			"id": 123,
			"fName": "John",
			"lName": "Doe",
			"score": 234
		},
		{
			"id": 124,
			"fName": "Jane",
			"lName": "Doe",
			"score": 543
		},
		{
			"id": 125,
			"fName": "Jackie",
			"lName": "Doe",
			"score": 453
		}
	]
}

The program should write each record to a output file (destination.txt) in the following format

First Name | Last Name | Score
123 | John | Doe | 234
124 | Jane | Doe | 543
125 | Jackie | Doe | 453


Requirements: Part 2:
We extend the Part 1 to  sort all the students based on their score (descending sort).

The program should write the sorted output to the destination.txt file as follows:

Id | First Name | Last Name | Score
124 | Jane | Doe | 543
125 | Jackie | Doe | 453
123 | John | Doe | 234


Requirements: Part 3:

We extend the Part 2 to generate an XML output in the destination.xml file as follows:

<students>
 <student id="124">
   <name>Jane Doe</name>
   <score>543</score>
 </student>
 <student id="125">
   <name>Jackie Doe</name>
   <score>453</score>
 </student>
 <student id="123">
   <name>John Doe</name>
   <score>234</score>
 </student>
</students>
